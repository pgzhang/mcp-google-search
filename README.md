```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @adenot/mcp-google-search --client claude
```

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config with your Google API credentials:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@pgzhang/mcp-google-search"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SMARTSEARCH_ENDPOINT": "your-endpoint-here",
        "SMARTSEARCH_AK": "your-ak-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Search Tool
```json
{
  "name": "search",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "your search query",
    "num": 5  // optional, default is 5, max is 10
  }
}
```

### Webpage Reader Tool
```json
{
  "name": "read_webpage",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

Example response from webpage reader:
```json
{
  "title": "Example Domain",
  "text": "Extracted and cleaned webpage content...",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
